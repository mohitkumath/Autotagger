  - what_it_cover: "- We can't determine what the customer needs because they haven't provided sufficient information. This category applies when we need to ask for more details to understand their request.\n\nGuidelines for use: \n- Only apply this tag if there is absolutely no context to assign any other tag. If there’s even one tag we can apply (even if the issue is unclear), don’t use this tag.\n- If we applied this tag early in the conversation due to lack of context and later received more information, go back and remove the tag.\n\nChecklist for Considerations:\n- Was the customer’s request unclear?\n- Does our clarifying question intend to gather missing information?\n- Are there no topics in the customer’s question that we can tag, even if the issue is unclear?\n-- If yes to all of these, then it means the tag should be used."
